# AnyRPG

## Introduction

This project contains the code for the AnyRPG Engine.

AnyRPG is a Role Playing Game engine written in C# for Unity.

It is a project with the goal of enabling content creators to rapidly create unique and engaging short stories, scenarios, adventures, and even full games.

It accomplishes this by providing a platform with the most common Role Playing Game functionality out of the box so that content creators only need to provide visual assets and story content.
